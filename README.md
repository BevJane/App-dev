##### My Favorite Movie

  The movie that makes my cry and my favorite is the Miracle Cell No 7.
  This movie is a Korean-movie that the father has mentally 
  dysfunctions but has a pure heart and meetings 
  the man has with his daughter while in prison 
  in the months that lead up to his execution and the 
  friendship he forges with his fellow inmates. 
  
  The **Moral Lesson** of this movie is people with *mentally dysfunctions*
  has a ***pure heart*** that even though they were punished, hurt their feelings
  by others, and misunderstood by many, they still ***love those people harmed them***. 
  This movie represents how badly people with disability were treated.
